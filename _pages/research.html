<p>I am an experimental physicist with an interest on structure and dynamics of amorphous materials, metallic glass-formers in specific.</p>
<p>I want to learn what keeps amorphous materials in their seemingly disordered structure, and which underlying order-disorder-phenomena dominate the amorphous state.</p>

<p>My current focus is on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>local structure and its connection to dynamics</li>
  <li>local elastic properties</li>
  <li>evolution of the amorphous structure in terms of physical aging and rejuvenation, and their connection to crystallization</li>
  <li>the relation between structure and macroscopic properties</li>
</ul>

<p>My expertise extends to the behavior of molecular and metallic glass-formers under external triggers such as time, temperature, electric fields, magnetic fields, microgravity, and others. I am further interested in the structural realizations of amorphous bulk material and thin-films and how these can be influenced by preparation parameters and dimension during the quench.
</p>
<p>Preferred methods of investigations are synchrotron-based coherent scattering techniques such as x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS), but also local electron-based scattering such as four-dimensional transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM). Further, nanoindentation in the elastic regime is my current method of choice to measure lateral elastic properties. Some of my current work is based on the combinatin of methods, such as elastomechanical manipulation during coherent scattering.

<!-- I would like to engage in research involving neutron scattering, physical vapor deposition and sputtering techniques, the combination of calorimetric, thin-film, and synchrotron aspects. It is important to me to relate to computational techniques that help understanding the origin of experimental observations by investigating properties that are not (yet) accessible by current experimental methods.
Further, I would like to engage in interdisciplinary projects that make use of the technological advantages of metallic glasses in application-relevant projects. -->
